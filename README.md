# Celebrity Look-Alike Finder

This project identifies the closest celebrity match for a given input image using DeepFace for facial recognition. The system compares a given image to a database of celebrity images and returns the closest match along with additional emotion recognition. This uses the **DeepFace** library for facial recognition, model loading, and embedding comparison.

## üìå Prerequisites  

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.10** or later  
- **pip 25.0** or later  
- **Virtual Environment** (recommended)

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository or Download as ZIP  

#### **For Cloning via Git**:  
If you have Git installed, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abinrajmk8/celebrity-look-alike.git
cd celebrity-look-alike
```

#### **For Windows Users (Download ZIP)**:  
If you do not have Git installed, you can download the repository as a ZIP file by clicking the "Code" button on the repository page, then select **Download ZIP**. After downloading, extract the contents and navigate to the extracted folder.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create & Activate a Virtual Environment  
It‚Äôs recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. You can create and activate the virtual environment using the following commands:

#### For macOS/Linux:  
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
#### activating the venv   (skip the above if u already have initialized a virtual environment)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows:  
```bash
python -m venv project_env
```
```bash
project_env\Scripts\activate
```

> Note: Replace `project_env` with the name of your virtual environment. and keep in mind that u dont need to create a virtual env every time u run the prgrm ,use the virtual env that u created earlier for this project ,just activate using the second command 

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages  
After activating the virtual environment, install the required packages for the project by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Tip: After adding or updating any packages, make sure to update `requirements.txt` using the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Samples Folder  
Before you run the project, ensure that the `Samples` folder is populated with images of celebrities. You can clone or download the folder using the  dataset repository. The system will load the images from this folder, compute embeddings, and store them in `sample_embeddings.pkl`.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Project  
Now that the setup is complete, run the project using the following command:

```bash
python celebrityDetector.py
```

> First Run: The first run of the program will take some time, as it will:
> - Download the required pre-trained models.
> - Process the images in the `Samples` folder.
> - Compute embeddings for each image.
> - Store the embeddings in `sample_embeddings.pkl` for faster future matches.

## This initial run can take **5-10 minutes**, depending on the number of images in the `Samples` folder and the system‚Äôs performance.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Modify Cache for New or Deleted Images  
To ensure your cache is always up to date, you can modify it whenever new images are added or existing images are deleted. You can do this using the `preload.py` script:

```bash
python preload.py
```

This will:
- Fully preload data (use Option 1) or
- Modify the cache to reflect any added or deleted images (use Option 2).

---

## üí° How to Use

Once the program is set up and the data is preloaded, you can run the main program (`celebrityDetector.py`), and it will:
- Capture a face from the webcam.
- Compare the captured image with the cached images.
- Show the closest match and the corresponding distance.
- Display the captured face and its closest match side by side.

---

## üìù Summary

This project uses **DeepFace** for facial recognition and matching celebrity images to a given input. The project is designed to work by preloading and caching celebrity images and embeddings. The steps include:
- Setting up a virtual environment.
- Installing the required packages.
- Preloading data for the first time.
- Running the program to capture and compare faces.
- Updating the cache when new images are added or deleted.

With these steps, you can run the **Celebrity Look-Alike Finder** and enjoy identifying the closest celebrity match based on facial recognition.
